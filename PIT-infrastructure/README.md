PRIMOR is a component-based system responsible for providing reading access from software components to the MARTs, executing model-related runtime operations,	and managing the propagation of changes among interconnected MARTs and their realities.

PRIMOR is responsible for managing MARTs' CRUD operations defined in the Operational Framework [See Dissertation Chapter 6]
PRIMOR's main functionalities are:
1. providing reading access from software components to the MARTs
2. executing model-related runtime operations
3. propagating changes among interconnected MARTs and their realities.

PRIMOR is implemented in Java, and designed to be extensible to other domains.
